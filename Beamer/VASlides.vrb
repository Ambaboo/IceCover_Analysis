\frametitle{SimPy Dequeue Operations}



When the next event is executed, these operations occur:

\begin{itemize}

\item [(iii)] remove head of list {\bf timestamps}, time t

\item [(iv)] reactivate (invoke Python iterator for) {\bf Run()} function
for event of time t in dictionary {\bf events}

\end{itemize}



Again, what would appear to be an O(1) event is actually O(n).
