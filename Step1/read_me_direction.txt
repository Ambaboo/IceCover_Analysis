Then for some initial analysis, it would be nice to see for each run:
1. Plots of mean sea-ice concentration over 2003-2010 for each run for march and September, for the region north of 55N, as well as a difference plots
2. Plots of concentration standard deviation over 2003-2010 for each run for March and September, for the same region, as as well as a difference plot
3. Plots of concentration for September 2007 and 2010 for each run, as well as difference plots
- Repeat of the above 3 items, for the sea ice thickness
4. Histogram of sea-ice thickness distribution, in 0.2 m thick bins, for each run over 2003-2010,
for each of March and September
