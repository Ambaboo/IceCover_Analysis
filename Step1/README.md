#Step1

##Introduction

Some initial aspects of the sea ice analysis, focussing on the model first. We will use 2 configurations, a 1/4 degree version companion run -- __ANHA4__, and our new 1/12 degree high resolution version -- __ANHA12__.


For each run in ANHA4 and ANHA12: 

- Plots of mean sea-ice concentration over 2003-2010 for each run for march and September, for the region north of 55N, as well as a difference plots
- Plots of concentration standard deviation over 2003-2010 for each run for March and September, for the same region, as as well as a difference plot
- Plots of concentration for September 2007 and 2010 for each run, as well as difference plots

Repeat of the above 3 items, for the sea ice thickness

- Histogram of sea-ice thickness distribution, in 0.2 m thick bins, for each run over 2003-2010, for each of March and September
